      <p className="lead">Wizard's Way began as a themed family Halloween display and has grown into a community event that raises donations and awareness for local charities.</p>

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>We are a local family from Boonsboro who started by creating whimsical, family-friendly themed displays for neighborhood trick-or-treat. Over the years our attraction grew in popularity — people asked to return, bring friends, and stay longer — and in 2022 we transitioned the one-night display into a multi-day community event. Our goal is always to create the "fun factor" (not the fear factor) with interactive elements, characters, scavenger hunts, and special events like the Yule Ball.</p>

      <h3>Why We Do It</h3>
      <p>We partner with local non-profits to collect donations and raise funds. Our beneficiaries include Katie's Cupboard (a Benevola United Methodist Church outreach that provides food and household essentials) and Books From Beau (a 501(c)(3) that provides books to pediatric patients). Proceeds and donated items from the event directly support these programs.</p>

      <h3>Community & Partnerships</h3>
      <p>We rely on volunteers, neighbors, and local businesses to help make Wizard's Way possible. We welcome sponsorships, donated goods, and in-kind support — in return we offer visibility in our event materials and on-site acknowledgement. We maintain an Amazon wish list and a GoFundMe for those who want to support the cause remotely.</p>

      <h3>Get Involved</h3>
      <p>If you're a business interested in partnering or sponsoring the event, please reach out via our <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page. We can discuss donation drop-off, sponsorship levels, and volunteer opportunities.</p>
